# Mosaic

**Make pictures out of pictures!**

Mosaic takes the idea of creating an image mosaic and gamifies it to encourage users to contribute their own images to build the target image. Users are unaware what the final image will look like, and are only shown a graph which indicates what colours the target image is still lacking.

This repo is a monorepo that contains the [mobile app](packages/app), [api](packages/api) and [web interface](packages/web).
